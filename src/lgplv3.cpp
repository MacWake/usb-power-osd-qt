"Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n"

"<p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an\n"

"<h4 id=\"section4\">4. Combined Works.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\n"
"taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\n"
"portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\n"
"engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\n"

"\n"
"<li>d) Do one of the following:\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n"
"License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n"
"suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n"
"recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n"
"the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n"
"manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n"
"Corresponding Source.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n"
"Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n"
"a copy of the Library already present on the user\'s computer\n"
"system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n"
"of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n"
"Version.</li>\n"

"\n"
"<li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n"
"be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n"
"GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n"
"necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n"
"Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n"
"Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n"
"you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n"
"the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n"
"Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n"
"Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n"
"for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>\n"

"<h4 id=\"section5\">5. Combined Libraries.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n"
"Library side by side in a single library together with other library\n"
"facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\n"
"License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\n"
"choice, if you do both of the following:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n"
"on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n"
"conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n"

"<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n"

"versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n"
"differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>\n"

"<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n"
"Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\n"
"of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;\n"
"applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n"
